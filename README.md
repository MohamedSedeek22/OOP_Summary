# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) PHP Example

This repository contains a PHP script that demonstrates various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP. It covers the following topics:

1. **Class Definition**: Defining a class `AppleDevice` with properties and methods.
2. **Constructor**: An example of a constructor (currently commented out).
3. **Methods**: Methods like `doubleHomePress`, `getinfo`, and `Ownername`.
4. **Constants**: Use of constants with `OWNERNAME`.
5. **Inheritance**: Inheriting from a base class (`Sony` extends `AppleDevice`).
6. **Abstraction**: Using an abstract class `Vehicle`.
7. **Polymorphism**: Demonstrating polymorphism with animals.
8. **Encapsulation**: Demonstrating encapsulation with a private property `lock`.
9. **Magic Methods**: Example of `__call`, `__get`, and `__set` magic methods.
10. **Static Methods**: Defining and using static methods.
11. **Traits**: Creating and using traits (`Hair` and `Eyes`).
