# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Example

## Overview

This repository contains a PHP script that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including classes, properties, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.

### Classes

The script defines a class called `AppleDevice` to represent Apple devices and another class called `Sony` that inherits from `AppleDevice` to represent Sony devices.

### Properties

The `AppleDevice` class has several public properties, including `ram`, `inch`, `space`, `color`, and `Ownername`, which store information about the devices.

### Constants

A constant named `OWNERNAME` is defined to set a character limit for the owner's name.

### Methods

Methods within the classes perform various actions, such as displaying device information, checking the owner's name length, and changing device locks.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is demonstrated using private properties and a method to change the lock.

### Abstraction

An abstract class named `Vehicle` is defined with abstract methods, and subclasses `Car` and `Motorcycle` implement these methods.

### Polymorphism

The script shows how polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `oop.php` script.

2. Open the script in a PHP development environment or a web server with PHP support.

3. Run the script to see how it creates instances of devices and vehicles, calls methods, and demonstrates various OOP principles.
